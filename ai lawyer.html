    content: `Article 3 – Formation of New States and Alteration of Areas, Boundaries, or Names of Existing States

Full Text:
Parliament may by law —
(a) form a new state by separating territory from any state or by uniting two or more states or parts of states;
(b) increase the area of any state;
(c) diminish the area of any state;
(d) alter the boundaries of any state;
(e) change the name of any state.

Explanation:
- Article 3 deals with the creation of new states, the reorganization of existing states, or the alteration of their boundaries or names.
- It allows Parliament to:
  - Form new states by either separating territory from an existing state or merging multiple states.
  - Change the size or geographical boundaries of any state.
  - Modify the name of any state.
- The process of altering state boundaries or names requires a law passed by Parliament, but it can only be done after obtaining the recommendation of the President of India.

Key Points:
- The President’s Recommendation is mandatory before any law affecting the creation of new states or altering existing states can be introduced in Parliament.
- The article provides a legal mechanism for the reorganization of states, which has been used historically (e.g., the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in 2014).`

Full Text:
Any law referred to in Article 3 which provides for the formation of a new state or the alteration of boundaries or names of any state shall not be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purposes of Article 368.

Explanation:
- Article 4 ensures that laws passed under Article 3 do not require a constitutional amendment, despite their significant impact on the country’s territorial configuration.
- The article clarifies that such laws are not considered amendments to the Constitution under Article 368 (which deals with the amendment process), meaning they can be enacted more easily without going through the rigorous constitutional amendment procedures.

Key Points:
- Laws passed to alter state boundaries, create new states, or change names are not subjected to the formal process of constitutional amendments.
- This article allows for greater flexibility in reorganizing the political boundaries of the nation.`
